Pizza Ordering System:

[![Watch](pizza.png)](pizza.mp4)

Using Java's abstract classes as well as Polymorphism, I developed a GUI using JavaFX which enabled the
users to order Pizza from a Pizza Store. The user is able to choose from the menu as well as build their own
from the various topping choices given to the user. When nished, the user is able to open their order on a
separate window and proceed to conrm their order, go back to the menu, or clear the order entirely.
